# About Us

Welcome to the CARE Lab at California State University, Northridge! We develop mechanisms, interfaces, and learning algorithms to facilitate seamless **human and robot interactions**. Our goal is to enable robots to understand humans, learn from them, and assist them in their daily lives. Our research is, by nature, interdisciplinary --- combining principles from *mechanical design*, *control theory*, and *machine learning*.

## Overview

We explore several aspects of human-robot interaction. Broadly, our work can be catergorized into three research thrusts:
**mechanism design**, **robot learning**, and **human modeling**.

Our research efforts are led by self-motivated and hard-working students from the CSUN community. We are **actively recruiting** --- interested undergraduate and graduate students should contact the PI (see contact on the team page).
